You have joined an extraordinary group of generous donors, volunteers, and dedicated employees who support at-risk seniors in our community. We are excited to welcome you in our efforts to ensure that no senior is left isolated or hungry.\n",

    "        Meals on Wheels is so much more than a provider of home delivered meals. We firmly believe that our volunteers crossing the threshold of our seniors’ homes provide sustenance to their health, independence, and well-being. We not only provide fresh, nutritious meals for 7 days a week, we are providing safety checks and friendly visits to seniors, especially to the 49% who live all alone. In fact, our volunteers may be the only people they see on a daily, or even weekly, basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "        We find that the real hunger our seniors face is for human connection. As one of our favorite volunteers once told me, “Sometimes, we’re the only family they’ve got.”\n",
    "\n",
    "        Thank you again for your recurring monthly contribution of $100 and your commitment to the seniors we serve. You will receive one acknowledgement at the end of each year for tax purposes unless you request monthly mailed statements. I would love to learn more about what Meals on Wheels means to you, so please consider this an open invitation to contact me. I’d love to take you on a tour of our Meal Center near Old Town or even to meet for coffee in your neighborhood. Please call me to set an appointment at your convenience.\n",

      "Welcome to our Meals on Wheels San Diego County family! We appreciate your thoughtful gift and want to personally thank you for your generous donation of $100. Your support plays a crucial role in empowering us to continue our mission of ensuring no senior citizen in our county is left hungry or isolated.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Meals on Wheels, we believe in lending more than a helping hand - we provide warmth, comfort and the familiar friendly face of our volunteers to create a sense of community for our seniors. As 49% of seniors we cater to live alone, this human connection we foster is as heartening and essential as the nutritious meals we deliver. It is people like you, Mrs. Allen, who enable us to ensure that this significant part of our society experiences the warmth and community they deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rest assured, your funds will contribute to a crucial service that goes above and beyond to meet the needs of our seniors. We also want to assure you that your dedicated support will be mentioned in our end-year acknowledgement, which can also serve as an official document for tax purposes as per IRS regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please know that we are always available and willing to connect. We would love to hear more from you, maybe show you around our center, or just meet for a cup of coffee. Please do not hesitate to get in touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, many thanks for your generous gift. \n",
